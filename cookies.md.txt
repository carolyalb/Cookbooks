### Ingredients

- 1 cup [227 g] unsalted butter at room temperature
- 1 cup [200 g] granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon [3 g] orange zest
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg yolk at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 cups [284 g] all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup [32 g] finely chopped candied orange peel
- 1/4 cup [43 g] semisweet mini chocolate chips
- 1 cup [200 g] turbinado sugar or sanding sugar

### Instructions

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the granulated sugar, orange zest, and salt, and beat again on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and add the egg yolk and vanilla, and mix on low speed until incorporated. Add the flour and mix on low speed until just combined. Add the candied orange peel and chocolate chips and mix again until combined.

2. Transfer the dough to a workspace and form the dough into a 12 inch [30.5 cm] long log. Place the log on a large piece of plastic, a few inches longer than the log. Sprinkle the turbinado sugar over each side of the log, covering the outside of the dough. Gently press the sugar into the dough with your hands. Wrap the log in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.

3. Position the oven rack in the middle of the oven, and preheat the oven to 350F [180C]. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.

4. Using a serrated knife, slice the dough log into Â¼ inch [6mm], and place the rounds about 2 inches [5 cm] apart on the prepared pans.

5. Bake, one batch at a time, until the edges are very light golden brown and the centers are still pale, 14 to 16 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking. Move the pans to wire racks and let cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
